Each player controls a spaceship with their mouse. The game can be won by capturing the planet by remaining near it for a short period of time, or by destroying the enemy spaceship. Both ships are equipped with torpedos which take a second to arm then accelerate forward as well as limited sensors. The sensors detect enemy acceleration but not much else and this information is delayed depending on the distance to the enemy.
